> Please note that I share my hardware configurations for fun and educational purposes only. Nothing prevents you from having a completely different configuration, be it better or inferior.

## Lab Workstation
This workstation is used for building my labs. It will be used as virutalization server:
### Hardware

### Software/Virtualization
For laboratory use, I opted for open-source software. So I installed [Proxmox](https://www.proxmox.com/en/proxmox-ve).

Proxmox Virtual Environment (PVE) is a free, open-source virtualization solution that enables the deployment of virtualized systems with Linux KVM or on Linux LXC containers, networking, storage and plenty other capabilities on a single platform.

You can follow installation tutorial here: [Proxmox Installation Guidee](/posts/proxmox-installation-guide)
