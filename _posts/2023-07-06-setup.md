## Software/Virtualization
For lab usage, I chose to go open source. I installed [Proxmox](https://www.proxmox.com/en/proxmox-ve).

Proxmox Virtual Environment (PVE) is a free, open-source virtualization solution that enables the deployment of virtualized systems with Linux KVM or on Linux LXC containers, networking, storage and plenty other capabilities on a single platform.

You can follow installation tutorial here: [Proxmox Installation Guide](_posts/2023-07-06-proxmox-installation-guide.md)
