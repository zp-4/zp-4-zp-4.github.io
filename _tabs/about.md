`**Job**`: Information Security Analyst
 
 #### I'm an information security enthusiast who's willing to learn new things whenever possible. I had a small experience as a pentester and now I'm in a blue team as an analyst.
 
 #### Through this blog, I'll try to share my knowledge and build labs that I hope will be useful to beginners and intermediates.
